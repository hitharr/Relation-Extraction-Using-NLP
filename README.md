# Relation-Extraction-Using-NLP
### Description
This project performs relation extraction between 2 named entitities in a sentence. The project has a CorpusReader which reads in the data files. From there a deep NLP pipeline is used to extract features from the natural langauge statementsm such as tokenization, lemmatization, POS tagging, dependency parsing, and WordNet extractions using Python libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and sci-kit learn. 

### Evaluation
The system was evaluated on the accuracy and maco precision, recall and F-scores for the predictions made by the model. The model was designed to classify both the relation and direction of the entities within the statements.
